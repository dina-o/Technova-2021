# Technova-2021

Taigaini creates an immersive experience through the compilation of all AAPI media–including music and content creators–for the community to learn more about and engage with. The website creates a safe and welcoming space for both the non-AAPI and AAPI community, to either learn more about Asian culture, or learn to be proud of their heritage. When engaging with our website, viewers should feel enticed and interested to discover more, as using our website is only half of the destination in achieving our ultimate goal. The AAPI needs greater representation online and through the media, and we hope to highlight these talented artists, actors, or creators in a new light and expose them to a wider audience.

Cool website features I'm proud of: 
- Image Hover Text Overlay Effect with HTML & CSS 
- Dropdown options on menu 
- Intervative and Smooth transitions (buttons, go to next page etc.)


Coded in HTML, CSS, and with love <333
